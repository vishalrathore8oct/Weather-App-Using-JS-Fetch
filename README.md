# Weather Dashboard

## Overview:
The **Weather Dashboard** allows users to search for the weather in a specific city. The app fetches data from the **OpenWeatherMap API**, displaying the current weather as well as a 5-day forecast. The weather details include temperature, weather description, humidity, wind speed, and weather icons.

## Features:
- **Current Weather:** Displays the temperature, weather description, humidity, and wind speed of the selected city.
- **5-Day Forecast:** Shows the weather forecast for the next 5 days (with data available for every 3 hours).
- **Error Handling:** Displays an error message if the city is not found or there is an issue fetching data.
- **Responsive Design:** The dashboard is designed to be responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

## How It Works:
1. **Enter City:** Users can enter the name of a city in the input field.
2. **Submit Form:** Upon submitting the form, the app makes an API request to fetch the current weather and the 5-day forecast for the city.
3. **Display Weather Data:** The app displays the current temperature, weather description, humidity, wind speed, and weather icon. It also shows a 5-day forecast with the temperature and description for each day.
4. **Error Handling:** If the city is not found or thereâ€™s a problem with the API, an error message is displayed.

## Installation:
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. Ensure you have an active internet connection to fetch data from the OpenWeatherMap API.

## Requirements:
- A modern web browser with JavaScript enabled.

## Technologies Used:
- **HTML:** For the structure of the page.
- **CSS:** For styling the weather dashboard.
- **JavaScript:** For making API requests and handling dynamic content updates.
- **OpenWeatherMap API:** For fetching current weather and forecast data.

## API Key:
You need an API key from OpenWeatherMap to access the weather data. Replace the existing `apiKey` variable with your own key.
